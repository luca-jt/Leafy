controller events
sampled animations from files
2D sprite hitboxes with seperate collision checking
cascaded shadow mapping
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
graphics improvement -> https://youtu.be/Uc8FEI5bg3w
scene files and loading of them in the rendering system
---------------------------------------------------------------------
conways game of life example
include asset files in binary if needed
other light source type (not point) with creation function
dpi scale factor event handling
ui basics + font rendering + events for ui struct
particle system https://youtu.be/GK0jHlv3e3w
sprite renderer -> depth layers configurable, sprite component
on collision event functions for entities?
collision + friction -> https://youtu.be/byP6cA71Cgw | https://youtu.be/4r_EvmPKOvY | generate hitboxes for mesh type (voxelization for custom?)
optimize shader program change
inertia matrix: correct origin for the center of mass -> add center of mass to the mass dist component?
recalculate inertia tensor / manage register data when needed automatically -> other components might be effected by get_component_mut() + queries too
add/delete commands that are dealt with once per frame for meshes/auto components/hitboxes -> code cleaner
