raytrace the current scene
switchable render backends -> vulkan support
skeletal animations
collision fix -> sequential solver? + better memory allocation + performance, terrain collision, trees
volumetric rendering -> voxels https://eisenwave.github.io/voxel-compression-docs/svo/svo.html
graphics -> https://youtu.be/Uc8FEI5bg3w, screen space effects, reflection with dynamic environment maps, water shader, post-processing: b/w, depth of field
scene files and loading of them -> serialization (serde) -> editor
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
cascaded shadow mapping -> dir light shadow maps need projection matrix size parameter
2D animation frames
2D sprite hitboxes with seperate collision checking
raycasting
particle system https://youtu.be/GK0jHlv3e3w | -> glPoints? , variants: facing the cam, decay time (has a distribution), permanent, ... , compute shaders?
ui basics + font rendering + events for ui struct (e.g. dpi scaling, mouse)

full rewrite of the rendering system
shading type in component -> add styles like cell shading -> together in renderable component?
object outlining with stencil buffer
bloom

replace expects and some unwraps with default returns and an error message in the logger when possible
asset data arena allocator
use the vertex colors
use all texture types and materials in the shaders
material texture loading with shininess textures with float values might cause problems
