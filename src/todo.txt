voxel renderer
controller events
intergrate certain settings inside a file
include asset files in binary if needed
sampled animations from files
cascaded shadow mapping -> map resolution setting
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
scene files and loading of them in the rendering system
graphics improvement -> https://youtu.be/Uc8FEI5bg3w
immutable event observer? + immutable engine field access functions?
dpi scale factor event handling
ui basics + font rendering + events for ui struct
particle system https://youtu.be/GK0jHlv3e3w
sprite renderer -> depth layers configurable
physics (+ friction + collision detection)
multiple light sources for the rendering system
change audio playback speed on animation speed change event + make that feature optional
change render behavior based on engine mode
