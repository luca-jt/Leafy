controller events
queries implementations with macros?
sampled animations from files
voxel renderer
cascaded shadow mapping
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
scene files and loading of them in the rendering system
lighting improvement
more query sizes
ui basics
font renderer
particle system
sprite renderer
collision detection
physics (+ friction)
multiple light sources for the rendering system
set model matrix for every entity (rotation, scaling) -> renderer rewrite (also change render behavior based on engine mode)
general query filter trait usage
