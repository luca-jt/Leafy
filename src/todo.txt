raytrace the current scene
switchable render backends -> vulkan support, use a static reference to a dyn trait object
skeletal animations

rebranding of the engine to Leafy and first publish, docs with links, readme
collision fix -> sequential solver? + better memory allocation + performance, terrain collision, trees
volumetric rendering -> voxels https://eisenwave.github.io/voxel-compression-docs/svo/svo.html
graphics -> https://youtu.be/Uc8FEI5bg3w, screen space effects, reflection with dynamic environment maps, water shader, depth of field
scene files and loading of them -> serialization (serde) -> editor
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
cascaded shadow mapping -> dir light shadow maps need projection matrix size parameter
2D animation frames
2D sprite hitboxes with seperate collision checking
raycasting
particle system https://youtu.be/GK0jHlv3e3w | -> glPoints? , variants: facing the cam, decay time (has a distribution)

add built-in shading styles like cell shading and custom shaders
make instance renderer able to render textured and colored at the same time?
ui basics + font rendering + events for ui struct (e.g. dpi scaling, mouse)
object outlining with stencil buffer
bloom
LODs dont support the vertex attributes so the usage of them in the shaders with textures and normal maps etc must fit
