voxel renderer
controller events
intergrate certain settings inside a file
include asset files in binary if needed
sampled animations from files
cascaded shadow mapping -> map resolution setting
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
scene files and loading of them in the rendering system
graphics improvement -> https://youtu.be/Uc8FEI5bg3w
immutable event observer? + immutable engine field access functions?
dpi scale factor event handling
ui basics + font rendering + events for ui struct
particle system https://youtu.be/GK0jHlv3e3w
sprite renderer -> depth layers configurable
on collision event functions for entities
physics -> friction
collision -> https://youtu.be/byP6cA71Cgw | generate hitboxes for mesh type (voxelization for custom) -> no need for double position/scale/orientation data, etc for hitboxes as they will be linked to entities
multiple light sources for the rendering system
