controller events
sampled animations from files
2D sprite hitboxes with seperate collision checking
cascaded shadow mapping
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
graphics improvement -> https://youtu.be/Uc8FEI5bg3w
scene files and loading of them in the rendering system -> serialization (serde)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
remove EventObserver trait and only use funcition events -> remove the shared pointer overhead
dpi scale factor event handling? -> render res handled by screen texture res (if that setting is in %, maybe scale that or smth)
custom render stages with shaders?
new rendering system with effect shaders that renders to a screen texture
dynamic mesh LOD usage
cap event loop update without frame rate drops?
fix fullscreen switch
sky box cube maps
conways game of life example
other light source type (not point) with creation function
ui basics + font rendering + events for ui struct
particle system https://youtu.be/GK0jHlv3e3w | -> glPoints?
sprite renderer -> depth layers configurable, sprite component
voxelized meshes -> Mesh becomes enum | https://eisenwave.github.io/voxel-compression-docs/svo/svo.html
seperate the ecs from the asset data to avoid unsafe mutable queries?
on collision event functions for entities? (-> with entity flag that is set in during collision)
collision + friction -> https://youtu.be/byP6cA71Cgw | https://youtu.be/4r_EvmPKOvY
reduce model matrix computations for every entity?
