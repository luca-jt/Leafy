controller events
animations
custom shaders?
graphics improvement -> https://youtu.be/Uc8FEI5bg3w
scene files and loading of them -> serialization (serde)
voxelized meshes + hitboxes (for non-convex cases) -> Mesh becomes enum | https://eisenwave.github.io/voxel-compression-docs/svo/svo.html
volumetric rendering -> voxels
raytracing the current scene
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
cascaded shadow mapping
using a different obj loader that also supports mtl files and support mtl files in the engine -> https://github.com/Twinklebear/tobj
---------------------------------------------------------------------
shader type is specifyable in component
rework the inertia and collision stuff -> collision point is slightly off
2D sprite hitboxes with seperate collision checking
cube shadow maps for point lights
particle system https://youtu.be/GK0jHlv3e3w | -> glPoints?
dpi scale factor event handling? -> render res handled by screen texture res (if that setting is in %, maybe scale that or smth)
materials -> reflection?
new rendering system with effect shaders that renders to a screen texture (for SSAO?) -> maybe only later
ui basics + font rendering + events for ui struct
conways game of life example
sprite renderer -> depth layers configurable, sprite component

Z buffer culling -> this will make it possible to not sort the objects for rendering transparent objects -> ignore everything that is translucent in z rendering
sky box cube maps -> https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Cubemaps
glsl preprocessor for including shader files and not copy and pasting everything
