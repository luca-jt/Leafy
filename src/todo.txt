controller events
sampled animations from files
voxel renderer
externally addded mesh files dont need path functions
cascaded shadow mapping -> map resolution setting
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
scene files and loading of them in the rendering system
lighting improvement
change render behavior based on engine mode
ui basics
font renderer
particle system
sprite renderer
material shaders
collision detection
physics (+ friction)
multiple light sources for the rendering system
app struct as template parameter in the engine -> no downcasting for app event functions
render distance that is changable through event
builder like engine creator for window title etc? or just events to change parameters in engine setup?
triangle mesh
disable shadows event + setting
more query sizes
queries implementations with macros
queries: check if next archetype is fitting components before setting it as current (not every time next is called)
