controller events
sampled animations from files
voxel renderer
externally addded mesh files dont need path functions
cascaded shadow mapping -> map resolution setting
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
scene files and loading of them in the rendering system
graphics improvement -> https://youtu.be/Uc8FEI5bg3w
change render behavior based on engine mode
ui basics + font rendering
particle system
sprite renderer
collision detection
physics (+ friction)
multiple light sources for the rendering system
app struct as template parameter in the engine -> no downcasting for app event functions
render distance that is changable through event
maybe rendering shadows between batches does not work correctly? -> change batch size beforehand? not dynamically?
make gl clearcolor changable (event) + change shadow map clear color
builder like engine creator for window title etc? or just events to change parameters in engine setup?
triangle mesh
disable shadows event + setting
more query sizes
