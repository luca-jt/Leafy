voxel renderer
controller events
intergrate certain settings inside a file
sampled animations from files
cascaded shadow mapping -> map resolution setting
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
scene files and loading of them in the rendering system
graphics improvement -> https://youtu.be/Uc8FEI5bg3w
immutable event observer? + immutable engine field access functions?
dpi scale factor event handling
change audio playback speed on animation speed change event + make that feature optional
change render behavior based on engine mode
ui basics + font rendering + events for ui struct
particle system
sprite renderer
collision detection
physics (+ friction)
multiple light sources for the rendering system
externally added mesh files dont need path functions -> include asset files binaries if needed + fix file path integration in general
render distance that is changable through event -> change rendering system behavior based on that
maybe rendering shadows between batches does not work correctly? -> change batch size beforehand? not dynamically?
