controller events
queries implementations with macros?
sampled animations from files
linux support
voxel renderer
cascaded shadow mapping
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
scene files and loading of them in the rendering system
lighting improvement
change render behavior based on engine mode
more query sizes
ui basics
font renderer
particle system
sprite renderer
collision detection
physics (+ friction)
multiple light sources for the rendering system
builder like engine creator for window title etc
triangle mesh -> mesh types not as enum but as struct containing file name
general query filter trait usage -> no specific filter usage methods in the entity manager
camera trait for different cam usage for the same renderers -> access to the matrices
mesh type not as enum but as struct containing the file name
mesh data not as cloned shared pointer?
