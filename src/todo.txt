vulkan support
skeletal animations
volumetric rendering -> voxels https://eisenwave.github.io/voxel-compression-docs/svo/svo.html
graphics -> https://youtu.be/Uc8FEI5bg3w, screen space effects, reflection with dynamic environment maps, water shader, depth of field
2D sprite hitboxes with seperate collision checking
ui advanced + editor
scene files and loading of them -> serialization
2D animation frames
cascaded shadow mapping -> dir light shadow maps need projection matrix size parameter
shadow anti-aliasing -> pcss
particle system https://youtu.be/GK0jHlv3e3w | -> glPoints? , variants: facing the cam, decay time (has a distribution)
collision fix -> sequential solver (or paper that i found)? performance, terrain collision, kd-Tree for range queries with aabbs
shader hot reloading
basic shape render primitives

PORT

first publish
raycasting
option to always pixel-align sprite positions (projection onto a grid?)
generic animations and linear interpolations for any parameter you want (map function ranges to time intervals, provide basic functions out of the box)
add built-in shading styles like cell shading and custom user shaders
ui basics + font rendering + events for ui struct (e.g. mouse)
